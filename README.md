## *Productivity* is a low level building block for human centric crypto systems

### WTF does that mean?

#### Think of it like an open database for all human work
#### If your a defi person think of it as a global liquidity pool for work

#### It is a smart contract, a flexible metadata standard, and 3 economic incentives

#### Incentives: 

1. For systems that generate NFT's of work to be done
2. For systems that find the best humans ( and systems ) to complete tasks
3. For humans ( and systems ) to complete work

Simply its a s stakeholders to have an economic reason to participate and new business models that promote freedom.

## Examples: ðŸ‘‡

#### Salesforse <-> NFT <-> Airtable
-> interoperability interface between different project management tools

#### Decentralized Upwork 
-> a global database for gig work that anyone can curate over to create âˆž vertical job marketplaces

#### Kleros 2.0 for X
-> Human in hte loop crypto systems should not have to one by one try to onboard humans.
-> You can rebuild things like kleros with this building block and start sourcing from a global pool of labor
-> incentive models built on top via "modules" similar to Lens Protocol & Decentralized ID + attestations

#### How can a smart contract call a human in 5 years without knowing who in advance?
-> Smart contracts being able to initiate tasks for humans opens a lot of doors for decentralized applications
